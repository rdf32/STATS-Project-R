# Capstone Data Science (M.S. Analytics) project
The final capstone project where we were tasked with taking mixed samples of dry white beans that consist of 6 different species,
make classification predictions, and then implement an algorithm to give a sample price prediction,
as well as a prediction on how accurate our price prediction for each sample is. My contributions to this problem include the following:
I took point on writing the code for the data visualizations, I designed and implemented the neural network classifier, I designed the algorithm we used 
for making a prediction on how accurate we thought our price prediction was, I wrote the R function we used to implement the algorithm I designed,
and I played a role in fine tuning a big portion of the overal code written for this project.
